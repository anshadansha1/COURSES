//The destructuring assignment syntax is a JavaScript expression that makes it possible to Unpack values.
//From Arrays,or properties from objects , into distinct variables.

let arr = ['Hi','I' , 'am' , 'Anshad'];

//Normal way of accessing Array elements :
let a = arr[1];
let b = arr[2];

console.log(a);
console.log(b);

//Instead we Have another Way - [DESCTRUCTING] to do this :

let [p , q ,r ,s] = arr ; //All the values of array will be assigned to respective variables.

console.log(e);
